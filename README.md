# LDPC-CC_Pipeline_Decoder

This is the source codes of a CUDA application named LDPC-CC_Pipeline_Decoder. 
Techniques of design and optimazation can be found in the article published in
the IEEE Communications Letters journal (The article is accepted just now).

In order to compile this project, Linux OS is recommended. Just open a terminal 
and go into the "src" directory. 

>cd src

Then compile all the codes using "make".

>make

A file named "decode" will be generated if everything goes right. Just execute 
the "decode" as follows.

>./decode

And you will see some information about decoding times and throughput printed on 
the terminal. You can clean all compilation using "make clean".

>make clean
